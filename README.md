Project during the Spring 2017 semester at Rutgers University, for the Numerical Analysis class. Uses Newton's Method and iterative proprtional scaling to estimate a 2x2 contingency table. Est_IPS and Est_MLE are original and all other files were supplied, with TestMultinomialSampling needing very slight modifications.
